# medical_image_denoising
This file provides a copy (mex function) of our code. Thanks to professor Xiaowei Yang's advice, I am still trying my best to optimize it in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.
With a simple modification of this algorithm, one can produce competitive performance in other 3D images (color image for example, we also provide our code for color image denoising for free). I am also trying to find a sound mathematical explaination. If you are interested in this issue, please contact me. I am eager to learn.
